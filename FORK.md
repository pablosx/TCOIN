# TCOIN — Fork Policy

## Purpose

This document defines how forks of the TCOIN project are allowed,
recognized, and differentiated.

Forking is not hostile.
Confusion is.

---

## 1. Right to Fork

Anyone may fork:
- The source code
- The ledger format
- The network model

No permission is required.

---

## 2. Naming Rules

Any fork that does **not** fully comply with `CANONICAL.md`:

- MUST NOT use the name **TCOIN**
- MUST NOT use the symbol **TCOIN**
- MUST clearly rename the project

Examples:
- ❌ “TCOIN Classic”
- ❌ “TCOIN v2”
- ✅ “XTCOIN”
- ✅ “TermuxCoinX”

---

## 3. Canonical Compliance

A fork may call itself **TCOIN** ONLY IF it:

- Preserves the original genesis event
- Honors the max supply of 15,000,000
- Respects the v0.1 Developer Wallet authority
- Does not alter ledger validation rules

If any of these change, the fork is **non-canonical**.

---

## 4. Ledger Forks

Ledger divergence may occur.

A ledger fork is considered canonical only if:
1. Genesis matches exactly
2. Total supply never exceeds max supply
3. Developer recovery rules are honored

Otherwise, it is a valid fork — but **not TCOIN**.

---

## 5. Economic Independence

Forks:
- Have no claim on TCOIN value
- Have no right to shared supply
- Have no automatic legitimacy

Value accrues to usage, not lineage.

---

## 6. No Retroactive Claims

Forks may NOT:
- Claim to replace TCOIN
- Claim to be “the real TCOIN”
- Rewrite history

Forks begin at the moment of divergence.

---

## 7. Philosophy

Forking is freedom.
Canon is identity.

TCOIN remains simple so forks can be creative —
without erasing the original.

---

## 8. Final Statement

You are free to fork the code.
You are not free to impersonate the canon.
