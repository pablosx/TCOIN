TCOIN

TCOIN is a minimalist, peer-to-peer digital cash system designed to run on everyday devices using Termux.

It is not a speculative token, not a smart‑contract platform, and not an experiment in complexity.

TCOIN exists to answer one question:

> What is the smallest, simplest form of real digital cash that can actually work in the real world?

What Makes TCOIN Different

Runs on phones (Android + Termux)

Peer‑to‑peer by IP (no miners, no mempool games)

Fixed supply (15,000,000 max — ever)

Human‑readable ledger (JSON, timestamped)

Deterministic genesis (no hidden pre‑mine)

Explicit authority model (no pretending code has morals)


TCOIN is intentionally boring. That is a feature.


---

How It Works (Plain English)

Each user has a wallet (public / private key pair)

Balances live in a shared ledger

Nodes sync ledgers directly with peers

Transactions are signed and timestamped

No mining, staking, or inflation


If two phones can see each other, they can transact.


---

Supply & Genesis

Max supply: 15,000,000 TCOIN

Genesis allocation: held by the Developer Wallet

Distribution: manual, transparent, intentional


There is no algorithmic minting. If supply changes, it is visible.


---

Developer Wallet (v0.1)

The v0.1 protocol includes a Developer Wallet with limited authority:

Recover funds in cases of theft or failed transfer

Correct ledger errors

Protect early users during experimental phase


This authority is explicit, auditable, and version‑bound. Future versions may reduce or remove it — but v0.1 is honest about it.


---

Forking

Forking is allowed. Confusion is not.

Code may be forked freely

Non‑canonical forks must rename

Ledger identity is defined in CANONICAL.md


See FORK.md for full rules.


---

What TCOIN Is Not

Not DeFi

Not a DAO

Not anonymous money

Not permissionless fantasy


TCOIN is cash.


---

Status

Version: v0.1‑genesis

Network: experimental

Security: evolving


Do not use TCOIN for anything you cannot afford to test.


---

Philosophy

> Code does not replace trust. It records it.



TCOIN chooses clarity over complexity.
