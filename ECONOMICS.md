TCOIN Economics & Backing Model

Overview

TCOIN is designed to be asset-agnostic digital cash.

It may be backed by any TCOIN‑approved asset, including:

Physical commodities (silver, gold, goods)

Fiat currency

Cryptocurrency

Labor, services, or real-world obligations


Backing is explicit, declared, and auditable, not implied.


---

Supply

Max supply: 15,000,000 TCOIN

Genesis allocation: 2,000,000 TCOIN (for initial circulation)

Developer wallet: Holds remaining supply for distribution


No new TCOIN can ever be minted beyond the maximum.

What “Backing” Means

Backing does not mean:

Automatic redemption

Algorithmic pegs

Guaranteed price stability


Backing does mean:

A real asset is voluntarily pledged

The issuer publicly states the backing

Users may choose to trust or reject that issuer


Backing is a social contract, not a protocol illusion.


---

Approved Assets

An asset may back TCOIN if it is:

Verifiable

Transferable (or redeemable)

Lawful in the issuer’s jurisdiction

Publicly declared


Examples:

“1 TCOIN backed by 1 gram of silver held by issuer X”

“TCOIN redeemable for USD on request”

“TCOIN backed by compute time or AI inference”



---

Multiple Backings

Different issuers may back TCOIN differently.

This creates:

Market choice

Price discovery

Natural competition


There is no single backing authority.


---

Developer Role (v0.1)

In v0.1, the Developer Wallet may:

Declare official backings

Publish audits or proofs

Revoke misleading backing claims


This authority:

Is transparent

Is version-bound

May be reduced or removed in future versions



---

Redemption

Redemption terms are:

Optional

Issuer-defined

Off-chain


The protocol does not enforce redemption.

Failure to redeem affects trust, not ledger validity.


---

Fiat & Crypto Compatibility

TCOIN can coexist with:

USD

Stablecoins

Bitcoin

Other cryptocurrencies


It does not attempt to replace them.

TCOIN exists to function where they cannot.


---

Economic Philosophy

> Money works because people agree it works.



TCOIN does not pretend otherwise.

It makes agreements visible.


---

Forks & Backing

Forks may:

Restrict approved assets

Enforce pegs

Remove developer authority


Such forks:

Must rename

Are not canonical TCOIN


See CANONICAL.md.


---

Final Note

TCOIN is not a promise of value.

It is a container for value, chosen by humans.
